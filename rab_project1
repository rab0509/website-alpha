        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="C:\Users\Owner\Downloads\rab_pic1.jpg">
        <p>My name is Rob Bogan and I am an aspiring software developer from Chandler, Ariziona. I have a diverse background which 
          includes work as a COBOL programmer (back in the day!), a digital IC design engineer, a volunteer with St.Vincent de Paul, 
          and a K-12 Substitute Teacher. I guess you might call me a <b>"Renaissance Man"</b></p>

        <h1>My Background</h1>
        <p>I have a somewhat of a diverse background. I have a B.S. in Math from the University of the District of Columbia. I have a 
          B.S.E.E. from Howard University, and I have a M.B.A. from the University of Phoenix. I have worked as a COBOL programmer 
          (back in the day!) for Booz-Allen and Hamilton, a digital IC design engineer for several high-tech companies, a volunteer with St.Vincent de Paul, 
          and a K-12 Substitute Teacher with the Chandler Unified School District. I guess you might call me a <b>"Renaissance Man"</b></p>

        <h1>Why Programming?</h1>
          <p>What fascinates me about programming is how the scope of software development, data management, and data security has 
          come to touch almost every fabric of our lives today. The field of software development offers a myriad of opportunities
          today for programmers who are motivated to tackle the challenges facing an ever-more inter-connected world. I want to be
          a software developer who is a problem solver helping meet the challenges of this industry.</p>
